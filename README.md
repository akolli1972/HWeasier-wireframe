## The process behind the application
In this assignment we had to create a simple html page with css components.
I first craeted an html page using key words such as :

    * 'header'
    * 'vav'
    * 'section'
    * 'article'
    * 'aside'
    * 'footer'
    * 'article'

After adding all these key words into my html, I then used css to format and style the page. Some of the css components i used in my stylesheet are: 

    * 'margin'
    * 'width'
    * 'overflow'
    * 'display'
    * 'text align'

## Technologies used

    -html
    -css
    -github
